## Project Description: NFT Book Marketplace with Rights Management
This project is a decentralized NFT-based marketplace where authors can publish books as NFTs, buyers can purchase them, and administrators can manage access, payments, and rights transfers. The marketplace supports role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

It consists of several key smart contracts that work together:

NFTBookContract ‚Äì Manages the creation, approval, and deletion of NFT books.
MarketplaceContract ‚Äì Allows users to list, update, and purchase NFT books.
RightsManagerContract ‚Äì Handles ownership rights transfers and approvals.
PaymentSplitterContract ‚Äì Distributes revenue among multiple recipients.
FundManagerContract ‚Äì Manages withdrawals and transfers of platform funds.
DEF_ADMIN_contract ‚Äì Implements role-based access control for admins, fund managers, and authors.
Workflow Overview
Each participant in the system has a different interaction flow. Below is a step-by-step breakdown for authors, admins, and buyers.

üìñ Author's Workflow: Creating and Managing NFT Books
Request to Publish a Book:

The author submits a publishing request via NFTBookContract, providing:
title (Book title)
bookHash (IPFS hash containing the book‚Äôs content)
recipient (Who will receive the NFT)
Approval & Minting:

A platform admin reviews and approves the request.
The NFT is minted and stored in NFTBookContract.
The book's metadata (title, author, IPFS hash, timestamps) is recorded.
Listing the Book on Marketplace:

The author lists their book via MarketplaceContract, setting a price in wei.
The contract verifies:
The author owns the NFT.
The author has the correct role.
Updating or Removing Listings:

The author can update the price of the NFT book.
If they wish to remove the book, they can delete the listing.
Request to Delete a Book (Before Purchase):

If the book has not been purchased, the author can request deletion.
A platform admin must approve the deletion.
Once approved, the NFT is burned, and metadata is removed.
üõ†Ô∏è Admin's Workflow: Managing Authors, Marketplace, and Funds
Granting and Revoking Roles:

The default admin grants PLATFORM_ADMIN_ROLE, FUND_MANAGER_ROLE, and AUTHOR_ROLE.
Platform Admins can grant or revoke the Author role.
Approving Book Publishing Requests:

When an author requests to publish, a platform admin must review and approve it.
Upon approval, the NFT is minted and assigned to the recipient.
Approving or Declining Deletion Requests:

If an author requests deletion, a platform admin must approve it.
If approved, the NFT is burned, and metadata is removed.
Managing Funds & Withdrawals:

Fund managers handle fund requests via FundManagerContract.
Admins approve fund withdrawals and fund transfers.
Updating Marketplace Contracts:

Admins can set or update the Rights Manager Contract address in MarketplaceContract.
üí∞ Buyer's Workflow: Purchasing and Receiving Rights
Browsing Listings:

The buyer views books listed on MarketplaceContract.
Purchasing a Book NFT:

The buyer sends ETH to purchase an NFT book.
MarketplaceContract verifies:
The listing is active.
The sent amount is sufficient.
Excess ETH is refunded (if applicable).
Payments are split among recipients via PaymentSplitterContract.
Receiving NFT and Rights:

After purchase, the NFT transfers to the buyer.
RightsManagerContract manages ownership rights and IPFS agreements.
Requesting Rights Transfer (if applicable):

A buyer may request additional rights transfers via RightsManagerContract.
The request is reviewed, and the author must approve.
Once approved, ownership rights are updated and stored on-chain.
