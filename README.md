# üìö NFT Book Marketplace with Rights Management

**project is under development, so you cant find any test files or autorisation implemented**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a **decentralized NFT-based marketplace** where authors can publish books as NFTs, buyers can purchase them, and administrators can manage access, payments, and rights transfers. The marketplace supports **role-based access control**, ensuring that **only authorized users** can perform specific actions.

### **Key Features**
- **NFT-based Book Publishing** ‚Äì Authors can publish books as NFTs.
- **Marketplace Listings** ‚Äì Authors can list and sell books.
- **Secure Payment Distribution** ‚Äì Payments are split between multiple recipients.
- **Role-Based Access Control** ‚Äì Admins manage platform operations.
- **Rights Management System** ‚Äì Buyers can acquire rights over NFT books.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Smart Contract Architecture**

The system consists of multiple smart contracts working together:

| Contract | Function |
|----------|----------|
| `NFTBookContract` | Manages book minting, publishing, and deletion of NFT books. |
| `MarketplaceContract` | Handles listing, updating, and purchasing of NFT books. |
| `RightsManagerContract` | Manages ownership rights transfers and approvals. |
| `PaymentSplitterContract` | Splits and distributes payments among multiple recipients. |
| `FundManagerContract` | Handles platform fund withdrawals and transfers. |
| `DEF_ADMIN_contract` | Implements role-based access control for administrators, fund managers, and authors. |
